description: I was responsible for the development of a landing page dedicated to promoting an action-focused campaign tied to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. The landing page included sections that integrated with the client's backend team, allowing users to view the number of coupons generated based on their spending on Bradesco credit cards, with the potential to win gift vouchers through a raffle.<br><br>Throughout the development process, I leveraged my expertise in front-end development to create a visually compelling and responsive design that aligned with the client's branding guidelines. I also collaborated closely with the client's backend team to ensure seamless integration and effective data tracking, including the implementation of analytics tools to monitor user engagement and campaign performance.<br><br>Unfortunately, the promotion was ultimately suspended due to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. Nonetheless, I remain proud of my contributions to this project and the impact it had in driving engagement with the Bradesco brand.
