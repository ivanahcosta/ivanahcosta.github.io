  I had the privilege of being involved in the development of a dedicated landing page for Bradesco, specifically designed to promote an action-focused campaign associated with the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. The landing page seamlessly integrated various sections that connected with the client's backend team. This allowed users to easily track the number of coupons generated based on their expenses with Bradesco credit cards, providing them with the exciting opportunity to participate in a raffle and potentially win shopping vouchers. To ensure a cohesive user experience, I utilized my front-end expertise to create a visually appealing and responsive design that perfectly aligned with the client's brand guidelines.

  Throughout the project, I worked closely with the client's backend team, fostering a collaborative environment that facilitated a smooth integration process and effective data tracking. By implementing advanced analytics tools, we were able to closely monitor user engagement and measure the campaign's performance. However, despite our efforts and dedication, the promotion unfortunately had to be suspended due to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. Although this was a setback, I remain proud of the work we accomplished and the seamless landing page we developed. The campaign may be revisited and adapted in the future, and I look forward to the opportunity to continue contributing to impactful projects like this.
