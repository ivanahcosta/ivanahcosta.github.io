description: "Landing page to present the action-focused promotion for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. In addition, the page had sections integrated with the customer's backend team, which allowed the user to see the numbers of coupons generated according to the amounts spent on Bradesco credit cards, which could turn into gift vouchers based on a raffle. The promotion was suspended due to the Covid-19 pandemic."
