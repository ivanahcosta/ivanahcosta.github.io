  I led the development of the redesign project for Bradescard's institutional website, which provides credit solutions on behalf of Bradesco. Our primary objective was to give the site a modern and clean aesthetic. Throughout the project, I actively participated in the UI and UX stages, collaborating closely with the design team and client to ensure technical feasibility.

  We implemented a contemporary design structure that emphasized collaboration with the development team. This allowed us to seamlessly integrate a client-approved tool into the website. Our development priorities included optimizing performance, ensuring accessibility, and streamlining maintenance to facilitate the addition of new features in the future.

  As the lead developer, I played a key role in ensuring that the website not only had a visually appealing design but also met technical requirements and industry standards. By actively participating in the UI and UX stages, I ensured that the website provided a seamless and engaging experience for visitors.

  Throughout the development process, we prioritized performance optimization to ensure fast loading times and smooth browsing. We also focused on making the website accessible to all users, adhering to accessibility guidelines. Additionally, we implemented a streamlined maintenance process to facilitate future updates and the addition of new features.

  I was excited to lead this project and collaborate with the design team and client to create a modern and user-friendly website for Bradescard.
