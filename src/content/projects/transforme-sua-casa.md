  I was involved in the development of a dedicated landing page for Bradesco which aimed to promote an action-focused campaign associated with the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. The landing page featured integrated sections that seamlessly connected with the client's backend team, enabling users to track the number of coupons generated based on their expenses with Bradesco credit cards. By participating, users had a chance to enter a raffle and potentially win shopping vouchers. I utilized my front-end expertise to create a visually appealing and responsive design that aligned with the client's brand guidelines, ensuring a cohesive user experience.

  Throughout the project, I collaborated closely with the client's backend team to ensure a smooth integration process and effective data tracking. We implemented analytics tools to monitor user engagement and campaign performance.

  Unfortunately, due to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, the promotion had to be suspended.
