description: As part of a comprehensive campaign to promote Bradesco's credit and debit card products across multiple brands, I contributed to the development of a landing page that enabled users to generate coupons based on their card spending, with prizes awarded through a drawing mechanism. The landing page was integrated with the client's main website and included a user login feature, which allowed users to access their coupons or opt out of the promotion.<br><br>During this project, I utilized my expertise in front-end development to create a visually appealing and user-friendly design that aligned with the client's branding standards. I also collaborated closely with the backend team to ensure seamless integration and effective data tracking, including performance analytics and user engagement metrics.
