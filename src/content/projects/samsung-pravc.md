  As a member of the team, I was responsible for maintaining Samsung's exclusive promotions redemption website. This involved consistently adding new features and conducting necessary code refactorings to improve the website's functionality and performance. We were committed to ensuring that the website remained up-to-date and user-friendly, providing a seamless experience for users to redeem their exclusive promotions.

  Throughout the maintenance process, we actively worked on enhancing the website's features and optimizing its codebase. This involved closely monitoring user feedback and identifying areas for improvement. By incorporating new features and refining the existing code, we aimed to enhance the overall user experience and streamline the redemption process. Our goal was to ensure that Samsung customers could easily access and redeem their exclusive promotions without any technical difficulties or complications.
