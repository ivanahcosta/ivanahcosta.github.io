  The project involved a collaboration between Bradesco and C&A, and we were promoting a campaign where customers who spent R$100 or more at C&A stores using the Bradesco credit card would receive coupons. These coupons could be entered into raffles to win prizes. Our webpage included various dynamic sections, allowing users to log in and check their coupons, track their spending amounts, and even unsubscribe from the campaign.

  As part of the team, I undertook the front-end development of the page. My main focus was to ensure adherence to the UI team's layout and incorporate modern CSS and JavaScript techniques. The ultimate goal was to provide a consistent experience across different browsers and devices. I specifically focused on creating the dynamic sections that would later be integrated into the client's back-end system. Once developed, these sections were presented on the landing page through an iframe.
