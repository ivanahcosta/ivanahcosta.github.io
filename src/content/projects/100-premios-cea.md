description: As a developer, the landing page for a Bradesco C&A card promotion was created. The promotion generated coupons that could be redeemed for prizes if they were drawn when the user spent R$100 or more. The landing page was integrated with the client's back-end team, allowing the user to log in and view their coupons.
