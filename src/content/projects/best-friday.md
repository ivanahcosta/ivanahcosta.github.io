description: I contributed to the creation of a three-page hotsite dedicated to promoting Meio & Mensagem's Black Friday 2017 promotions while also encouraging newspaper subscription renewals and new subscriptions. The project required careful attention to user experience, and we employed various design and technical features to ensure the website was engaging and effective in meeting its goals.
