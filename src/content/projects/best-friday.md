  I was involved in the development of a three-page hotsite exclusively dedicated to promoting Meio & Mensagem's Black Friday 2017 promotions and encouraging renewals and new subscriptions to the newspaper. Our primary focus throughout the project was to prioritize the user experience, ensuring that visitors would have an engaging and seamless journey on the site.

  To achieve this, we utilized a variety of technical and design resources, harnessing their potential to create an impactful and effective platform that successfully fulfilled its objectives. We carefully crafted the layout and design elements to capture the attention of the target audience and provide them with a compelling experience.

  Throughout the development process, we remained dedicated to optimizing the user experience. We conducted rigorous testing and made necessary refinements to ensure that visitors would have a smooth and enjoyable interaction with the hotsite. Our goal was to create an enticing platform that effectively showcased Meio & Mensagem's Black Friday promotions and encouraged both renewals and new subscriptions to the newspaper.

  We were excited to contribute to this project and create a website that not only met the objectives of promoting the promotions but also provided a positive and engaging experience for visitors.
