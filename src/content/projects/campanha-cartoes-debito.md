description: As part of a campaign to promote the use of Bradesco's debit cards, I contributed to the development of a landing page designed to encourage customers to unlock and make transactions using their cards. The landing page was tailored to appeal to Bradesco's target audience and included clear calls-to-action, along with intuitive navigation and an engaging visual design.<br><br>During this project, I leveraged my technical expertise in front-end development to create a seamless user experience, while adhering to the client's branding guidelines. I also implemented effective tracking and analytics tools to monitor user engagement and website performance, including click-through rates and conversion rates.
