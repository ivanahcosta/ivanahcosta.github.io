description: As a team member of the Burger King project, I was involved in the development of a comprehensive system aimed at promoting and facilitating the process of acquiring a franchise. This three-part system consisted of a landing page designed to showcase the benefits of owning a franchise and collect information from interested parties, an administrative system to assist users in the acquisition process, and a management system to enable the sales team to efficiently contact and follow up with potential clients. The project required a high degree of technical expertise in web development, user experience design, and database management to ensure a seamless and effective user experience.
