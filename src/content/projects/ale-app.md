description: I developed a landing page with a targeted content strategy to promote the Ale's android and iphone app to its customers. Working alongside the backend team, we implemented a segmentation approach for content personalization.<br><br>By adding subtle, scrolling-based interactions and engaging details, we created a more dynamic and immersive experience for users. This not only made the page more visually appealing, but also helped to keep users engaged and interested in the content.
