  Throughout the project, I diligently maintained the website, continuously introducing fresh features and performing necessary code refactorings. A key aspect of this process was close collaboration with the back-end team, which ultimately led to the successful creation of a user-friendly CMS interface.

  The CMS interface we developed proved to be invaluable for Faber Castell employees as it allowed them to effortlessly update the content on the website. This interface streamlined the content management process, ensuring that the website remained up to date and relevant.

  By working closely with the back-end team, we were able to understand the requirements and needs of the Faber Castell employees. This understanding guided us in creating an intuitive and user-friendly CMS interface that catered specifically to their needs. The interface enabled seamless updates to the website's content, empowering the employees to keep the website fresh and engaging for visitors.

  I took great pride in maintaining and improving the project, ensuring that the website remained functional, visually appealing, and up to date. The collaboration with the back-end team was crucial in achieving our goals, and the user-friendly CMS interface we created provided a valuable tool for Faber Castell employees to manage the website's content effectively.
